= Current Issue =

get_comments doesnt let you modify the depth. looks like we need a different

= Setup =
1. run git update-index --assume-unchanged config
		1. this is so you don't accientally commit your username/password to the repo
2. modify config with your bot's username and password
3. I'm using the Reddit:Client library available from CPAN. (to understand how it work this blog was valuable: http://perltricks.com/article/151/2015/2/9/Build-a-Reddit-bot-with-Perl)
